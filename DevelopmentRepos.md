If you are developing, please CC the mailing list on any pull requests, or
simply post the code on the mailing list.

The "master" tree in the central repo should always contain runnable, high quality code. We go out of our way to ensure nothing goes to the central repo without a barrage of regression tests and code reviews.

That aside, use at your own risk.
